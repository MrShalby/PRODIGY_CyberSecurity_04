🖥️ Keylogger in Python
This is a simple keylogger written in Python using the pynput library. It captures keystrokes in real time and logs them to a file (keylog.txt). The logger handles both normal characters and special keys (like Space, Enter, Tab) and exits safely when the Escape (Esc) key is pressed.
